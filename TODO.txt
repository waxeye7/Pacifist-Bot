4 corner room mineral miner
make spawn more carry based on if the carry function made the full amount of parts


--SQUAD QUAD--
cache quad squad movement inside target room if position is unchanged or after x ticks
add same quad inter room pathing trick when turning corner of room to make more efficient movement
make quads bounce if too much damage
quads smarter and kill structs in range 2 of enemy ramparts potentially.

:thinking: make a kind of raider role that walks around different rooms triggering a costly response but only committing as long as the response is not there
make ram smarter by retreating on lower hits and or tower damage too high - wait to drain tower first.

make roles like the priest request and use observer!
