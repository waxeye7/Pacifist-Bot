--SQUAD QUAD--
cache quad squad movement inside target room if position is unchanged or after x ticks
add same quad inter room pathing trick when turning corner of room to make more efficient movement
make quads bounce if too much damage
quads smarter and kill structs in range 2 of enemy ramparts potentially.

make roles like the priest request and use observer!
