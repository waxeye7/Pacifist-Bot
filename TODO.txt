LAB:
lab manager when there is room danger to reallocate labs to boosting

DANGER:
make variable that increases by 1 every tick that room memory danger is true and then fire off extra measures code if that's the case.

BUILD:
auto rampart perimeter placement
RCL8!?
build road to closest rampart in bunch
perhaps make remote roads go lower costmatrix on roads

ALMOST DONE:
problem with recycling the parts for the rampart defender

DISTANT FUTURE:
attack code ~
