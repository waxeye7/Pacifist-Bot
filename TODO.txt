LAB:
lab manager when there is room danger to reallocate labs to boosting
loop through every lab pair

DANGER:
make variable that increases by 1 every tick that room memory danger is true and then fire off extra measures code if that's the case.

BUILD:

lookForAtArea(type, top, left, bottom, right, [asArray])
Lab placement 5x5 windmill stamp requires 25 free space in 5x5 find a place for it!

auto rampart perimeter placement
RCL8!?
build road to closest rampart in bunch
perhaps make remote roads go lower costmatrix on roads

ALMOST DONE:
problem with recycling the boost parts for the rampart defender

DISTANT FUTURE:
attack code ~
