NOT DONE AT ALL:

make road repair in each room when gets below threshold instead of having towers repair

lab reaction

boost

attack code

auto rampart perimeter placement

lab manager
count amount of different resources dropped on floor in tombstone instead of counting just 1. too risky before potential attack.

on room.memory.danger repair repairs the closest to rampartoman within 5 blocks maybe unless there is one below x

sweeper spawn body based on how much energy on the floor
access memory through Memory.rooms.roomname instead of Game.rooms[roomname].memory

ALMOST DONE:
