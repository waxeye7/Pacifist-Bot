NOT DONE AT ALL:

automate all construction of all buildings

perhaps works on the repair when room attacked and make him not walk into them better when there are more repaierers there or maybe i just get a boost and less creeps repair to make better defence
make road repair in each room when gets below threshold instead of having towers repair

make repair boost for when under siege

lab reaction

boost

attack code

auto rampart perimeter placement

lab manager
count amount of different resources dropped on floor in tombstone instead of counting just 1. too risky before potential attack.

on room.memory.danger repair repairs the closest to rampartoman within 5 blocks maybe unless there is one below x

sweeper spawn body based on how much energy on the floor
access memory through Memory.rooms.roomname instead of Game.rooms[roomname].memory

ALMOST DONE:
problem with recycling the  parts for the rampart defender
might be a problem with path finder in below E14S37 because one is trying to be built on a wall !?!?!?!?/




don't repair the container that's not in the route omg
