# BASE PLANNER PERFECTION GOAL

**Paste this whole document as the goal prompt.** It is the distilled criteria from the
owner's design sessions. The bar is: **every base plan is genuinely perfect — a harsh
reviewer finds NOTHING to criticize.** Not "gates pass." Nothing to criticize.

## Mission

Iterate the v2 base planner (`tools/plan-suite/v2/`) through build → validate →
adversarial-review → fix cycles until **two consecutive adversarial review rounds by
fresh hostile reviewers produce zero confirmed findings of any severity**, all hard
gates hold on all rooms, and the gallery reads as intentional, elegant, and unique
per room. Rise to the bar; do not lower it.

## Process (non-negotiable)

1. **Fable curates, Opus implements.** Each cycle: a tightly specified implementation
   batch (Opus), then the full suite + validator, then **fresh adversarial reviewers**
   (Opus) who must actively try to BREAK the result with their own code and data —
   never trust the planner's own meta, always re-derive. Confirmed findings become the
   next batch's spec. Repeat.
2. Reviewers must cover, every round: game-rule legality, validator circularity
   (mutation-test it), the gates below, the judgment criteria below, and 5 randomly
   sampled rooms inspected visually (render → describe → criticize like the owner would).
3. Live verification each cycle: re-push plans to the live test rooms, watch them build,
   zero console errors, no regressions on legacy rooms.
4. Terminate only on: 2 consecutive all-clean adversarial rounds + gates green +
   golden-room visual pass. If a criterion is physically impossible in a specific room,
   the plan must SAY so in its meta (honest shortfall), and the reviewer must agree it
   is genuinely impossible — that is the only accepted exception.

## Hard gates (validator-enforced, 100% of claimable 2-source rooms)

- **60/60 extensions at RCL8. Always.** (Honest-impossible exception per above.)
- Full program: 10 labs (diamond, both inputs within range 2 of every output, hauler
  access), 6 towers, 3 spawns, storage+terminal+hub trio on a sitter tile, 4+ links
  (hub, per-source, controller), source containers, controller container, mineral
  container + extractor, nuker, observer. **No factory. No power spawn. Never power.**
- Shell: distance-weighted min-cut, all ramparts, no openings, no double shell.
  Protect region sealed — zero leaks (re-derived exterior flood, not trusted meta).
- Safety re-derived: every eco structure at chebyshev depth ≥ 4 from the exterior
  region **or** carrying a personal rampart. Towers depth ≥ 4, no exceptions.
- Every extension has a **road on an orthogonal (D4) face** — easily accessible,
  corridor pattern, never a maze, never diagonal-only.
- One connected road network touching every structure. No roads ON ramparts. Spur
  roads TO rampart clusters allowed. Roads exist only for: hub kit, eco paths,
  lab road, tower faces, extension corridors, rampart spurs. Dead ends pruned.
- No structure on source/controller/mineral tiles (extractor on mineral exempt),
  no illegal stacking, no out-of-bounds, full CONTROLLER_STRUCTURES cap compliance —
  and the validator itself must catch injected mutations of every class it checks.
- Interior connectivity invariant: interior walk region stays one component reaching
  the sitter and a face of every structure, at every placement step.
- Deterministic output; full plan ≤ ~200ms per room offline.

## Optimization objectives (minimize / maximize — reviewer judges trade-offs)

- **MINIMIZE total rampart count** (shell + personal). Ramparts decay; every rampart
  is forever-upkeep. NEW EMPHASIS from the owner: place buildings deep enough
  (depth ≥ 4) that they don't need personal ramparts at all — a layout that pushes
  buildings into the shallow band and papers over it with personal ramparts is a
  WORSE layout even if "safe." Treat each personal rampart as a real cost inside
  placement scoring, not an afterthought. Shallow-structure count per room should
  trend toward zero except where the room genuinely has no deep space.
- Minimize road count (fleet median < 90 held; fewer if it costs nothing else).
- Minimize eco distances: hub↔sources, hub↔controller, with **controller proximity
  weighted slightly ABOVE source proximity**; mineral proximity barely matters.
- Maximize anchors inside the wall: enclose sources/controller when the cut cost is
  small ("it's good to have stuff inside — it's all about defence"). The core may sit
  OFF-center, hugging a source or the controller, when that buys enclosure. Layouts
  need not be square or centered.
- Defender mobility: internal wall-to-wall paths must not exceed attacker external
  paths ("attacker walks 10, I refuse to walk 20") — target max ratio ≤ 1.2 per room,
  and the reviewer flags every room above 1.0 with a judgment call.
- Tower coverage: equalize damage across ALL wall faces (towers fall off hard with
  range), spread, refill-distance weighted; the first-built tower (array order) must
  be the easiest to refill.
- Controller outside the wall: rampart ONLY its adjacent ring (denies claim-attack
  stands) + link + container. Nothing wider.

## Judgment criteria (the owner's voice — reviewer applies these to sampled rooms)

- "Placed with intent, elegant" — nothing that looks accidental, no spam, no filler.
- "Hyper dynamic, grown from the room" — layouts must differ meaningfully across
  terrain; identical-looking rooms on different terrain = fail.
- "Dense but walkable" — extensions flank corridors; a filler tour is short and obvious.
- "Easily defensible, low actions to maintain in late game" — small shell, low upkeep,
  link-based logistics, minimal moving parts.
- Storage is the center of gravity; spawns spread around it, easy to refill, fanned
  into different sectors (never clumped — adjacency has no mechanical value).
- Battlement metadata present where defenders should stand.
- The plan gallery page + animation must make the reasoning legible ("watch the
  planner think") and match the plan tile-for-tile.

## Anti-patterns (auto-fail if a reviewer finds one)

- Sparse checkerboard extensions; solid extension bricks; extensions walled in.
- Road spam / city grids / roads on every rampart / roads serving nothing.
- Towers clumped on the hub; towers or eco within ranged-attacker reach (depth ≤ 3,
  unramparted); safety measured against the wall list instead of the exterior region.
- Score-chasing: optimizing a number while the layout worsens. The gallery is the
  final judge, not the score.
- Silent failure or silent capping — every shortfall must be loud and explained.
- Repair-loop architecture: a layer that "fixes" a previous layer's output instead of
  the previous layer being corrected at the source.

## Tooling (already built — use it)

- Suite: `fnm exec --using 22 node tools/plan-suite/v2/plan.mjs --all-claimable`
- Validator: `.../validate.mjs` (extend it whenever a reviewer finds an unchecked class
  — then mutation-test the new check)
- Anims: `.../export-anim.mjs --all` · Gallery: http://127.0.0.1:8766/
- Live: `push-plan.mjs <room> --user pacifist --adopt`, live view at /live/,
  spawn-in / expansion pack tooling under `tools/server/`
- Docker mongo has all room terrain; ~159 claimable rooms is the test fleet.
