I have used this to setup my typescript screeps bot.

Screeps Typescript Starter is a starting point for a Screeps AI written in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). It provides everything you need to start writing your AI whilst leaving `main.ts` as empty as possible.

some notes for using my bot (jk no one does)

run "global.profiler = true" into screeps console to see where CPU is being spent
